**Using Continue.dev with Ollama for Local AI Code Assistance**

**Introduction**

Continue.dev is an open-source AI code assistant that integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code and JetBrains. It leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to provide features like code completion, code chat, and code editing directly within your development environment.

Ollama, another open-source tool, simplifies the process of running LLMs locally on your computer. By combining these two tools, you can unlock the potential of AI-powered code assistance without relying on external servers.

**Benefits of Using Continue.dev with Ollama:**

- **Privacy:** Your code and development data remain secure on your local machine.
- **Performance:** Local execution significantly reduces latency and improves responsiveness.
- **Customization:** You have the freedom to experiment with various LLM models.
- **Cost-Effective:** Eliminates the need for cloud-based AI services.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Continue.dev:** Install the Continue extension for your IDE from the official marketplace.
- **Ollama:** Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/).

**Setting Up Ollama:**

1. **Install Ollama:** Follow the installation instructions provided on the Ollama website.
2. **Download an LLM Model:** Use the `ollama pull` command to download your desired LLM model. For example, to download the Llama 3.1 model:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```

**Configuring Continue.dev:**

1. **Open the Continue.dev Extension:** Click on the Continue.dev icon in your IDE.
2. **Add a Chat Model:** Click on the "Add Chat Model" button.
3. **Select Ollama as the Provider:** Choose Ollama from the dropdown menu.
4. **Select the Model:** Choose the model you want to use (e.g., llama3.1) or use can choose Autodetect.
5. **Connect:** Click the "Connect" button. This will automatically configure Continue.dev to use your local Ollama server.

**Using Continue.dev with Ollama:**

Once you've completed the setup, you can start leveraging the power of Continue.dev:

- **Code Completion:** As you type code, press `Tab` to receive intelligent suggestions based on the context and the LLM's understanding.
- **Code Chat:** In the Continue.dev sidebar, you can ask questions about specific code snippets, functions, or your entire codebase.
- **Code Editing:** Select a code section and use Continue.dev's features to rewrite, refactor, or explain the code.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Experiment with Different Models:** Ollama supports a variety of LLM models. Try different models to find the best fit for your needs.
- **Optimize Ollama Server:** Configure Ollama's resource allocation (CPU, GPU, memory) to maximize performance.
- **Fine-tune Continue.dev Settings:** Explore Continue.dev's configuration options to customize its behavior.

By following these steps, you can effectively harness the power of AI code assistance locally with Continue.dev and Ollama.
